# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues preventing the application from running properly on Windows systems and fixes broken OAuth authentication flow. The scope includes Windows compatibility fixes, OAuth flow debugging and repair, and cleanup of problematic GitHub workflow configurations to restore the application to a simple, working state across platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Windows user, I want the application to run without platform-specific errors, so that I can use the application regardless of my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Windows user runs `python app/main.py` THEN the system SHALL start without ForwardRef._evaluate() or other Python compatibility errors
2. WHEN the application accesses configuration files on Windows THEN the system SHALL use proper Windows-compatible file paths
3. WHEN the application creates or reads files on Windows THEN the system SHALL handle Windows file permissions correctly
4. WHEN the application uses type annotations THEN the system SHALL be compatible with the Python version and typing system being used
5. IF the application uses shell commands THEN the system SHALL use Windows-compatible command syntax

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user completing OAuth authentication, I want the authentication to succeed when I authorize the application, so that I can access protected features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes the OAuth authorization flow THEN the system SHALL successfully exchange the authorization code for access tokens
2. WHEN OAuth tokens are received THEN the system SHALL store them securely and mark authentication as successful
3. WHEN OAuth authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific failure reason
4. IF OAuth tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh automatically or prompt for re-authentication

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the project, I want clean and functional build processes, so that the project remains maintainable and deployable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing GitHub workflows THEN the system SHALL have only necessary and working workflow configurations
2. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL use simple, reliable build processes without complex executable packaging
3. WHEN deploying or running the application THEN the system SHALL work with standard Python deployment methods
4. IF executable packaging is needed in the future THEN the system SHALL be designed to easily add it back without breaking existing functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user running the application, I want a simple and reliable startup process, so that I can quickly get the application running without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN the system SHALL use straightforward Python execution methods
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about startup status and any configuration issues
3. WHEN configuration is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and guidance
4. IF dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which packages need to be installed
