- [ ] 2.3 Improve OAuth error messages and user feedback
  - Update authentication status responses to provide specific error details
  - Add clear error messages for different failure scenarios (missing credentials, invalid tokens, etc.)
  - Test OAuth flow end-to-end to ensure success/failure states are properly communicated
  - _Requirements: 2.3_

- [ ] 3. Fix Windows compatibility issues
  - Update file path handling to use pathlib consistently for Windows compatibility
  - Fix static file mounting and configuration file access on Windows
  - Ensure server startup works properly on Windows systems
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.5_

- [ ] 3.1 Fix file path handling for Windows compatibility
  - Update app/core/config.py to use pathlib.Path for all file operations
  - Fix static file mounting in app/main.py to use proper cross-platform paths
  - Ensure all file access uses Windows-compatible path separators
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 3.2 Fix server startup and configuration loading on Windows
  - Update app/main.py to handle Windows-specific startup issues
  - Ensure configuration files are loaded correctly on Windows
  - Test that `python app/main.py` works without errors on Windows
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 4. Clean up GitHub workflows
  - Remove complex PyInstaller build configurations from GitHub workflows
  - Simplify workflows to basic Python testing only
  - Remove executable packaging and artifact generation
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 4.1 Remove executable packaging workflows
  - Delete or simplify .github/workflows/build-and-release.yml to remove PyInstaller builds

  - Keep only basic testing workflow if needed
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 4.2 Update remaining workflows for simplicity
  - Modify .github/workflows/test.yml to focus on basic Python compatibility testing
  - Remove complex build matrices and artifact generation
  - Ensure workflows test core functionality without executable packaging
  - _Requirements: 3.3_

- [ ] 5. Test and validate fixes
